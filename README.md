Welcome to PayCrypt Seamless Crypto Payments for Africa â€” Starting with Nigeria Imagine sending money to your friend in Lagos as easily as sending a WhatsApp message. Right now, if you want to send crypto to someone, you need to copy and paste a 42-character wallet address that looks like this: 0x742d35Cc6634C0532925a3b8D4C0532925a3b8D4. One wrong character? Your money disappears forever. 
PayCrypt changes everything. Instead of that nightmare, you simply send to @john or @sarah_lagos. That's it. No more copying addresses, no more fear of losing funds, no more barriers to digital payments

Here's what makes PayCrypt revolutionary for Africa: 

1. @Tag Payments - Replace 42-character addresses with simple tags like @yourname 
2. Instant NGN Conversion - Receive crypto, instantly convert to Naira via Paystack 
3. Multi-Chain Support - Works across Ethereum, Base, Starknet, and Core networks 
4. NGN Bank Withdrawals - Move funds to your Nigerian bank account in seconds 
5. KYC Compliant - Fully regulated and secure for legal transactions The African crypto market is exploding - Nigeria alone processes over $400M in crypto monthly. But adoption is stuck because crypto is too complex for everyday people.

PayCrypt makes crypto as simple as mobile money, but with global reach and lower fees. We're not just building a payment app - we're building the financial infrastructure that will connect Africa to the global digital economy. The future of money is here. It just needed to speak our language.
